            <p><strong>Who are we?</p>
            <p> In the early 21st century, a group of dedicated scientists came together to form DHMO.org, a platform with a mission to raise awareness about the lesser-known substance, Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO).<br> Their primary goal was to educate the public about the widespread presence of DHMO and its potential environmental and health impacts. Since then we have helped the public get more educated about "the invisible killer". <br> <br>Over the years, DHMO.org has become a trusted source for information on DHMO and its implications. We have published extensive research reports, conducted educational campaigns, and engaged with communities worldwide to shed light on the significance of this common but often overlooked compound. Our efforts have led to increased awareness about the responsible use of DHMO and its vital role in our daily lives.  <br> <br>
                
                As we move forward, DHMO.org remains dedicated to its mission of providing valuable insights and fostering a deeper appreciation for the intricate role DHMO plays in our environment and well-being. Our journey to unveil the mysteries of DHMO continues, ensuring that everyone is equipped with the knowledge needed.
